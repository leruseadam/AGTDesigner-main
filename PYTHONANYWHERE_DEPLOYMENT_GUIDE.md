# PythonAnywhere Deployment Guide

## âœ… Your Project is Ready for Deployment!

I've created a deployment package that includes all your weight field fixes and bypasses the git issues.

### ðŸ“¦ Deployment Package Created
- **File**: `AGTDesigner_deployment.zip`
- **Size**: Optimized (excludes large database files)
- **Includes**: All weight field fixes for concentrate products

### ðŸš€ Step-by-Step PythonAnywhere Deployment

#### 1. **Upload to PythonAnywhere**
- Go to your PythonAnywhere dashboard
- Click on **Files** tab
- Upload `AGTDesigner_deployment.zip` to your home directory

#### 2. **Extract the Files**
```bash
cd ~
unzip AGTDesigner_deployment.zip
```

#### 3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip3.10 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. **Update WSGI File**
- Go to **Web** tab in PythonAnywhere
- Click on your WSGI file
- Update the path to point to your new `app.py`:
```python
import sys
path = '/home/yourusername/AGTDesigner_deployment'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

from app import app as application
```

#### 5. **Reload Your Web App**
- Click **Reload** button in the Web tab

### âœ… Weight Field Fixes Included

Your deployment includes these critical fixes:

1. **Enhanced Frontend Weight Field Extraction**
   - Checks all weight field variations (`WeightWithUnits`, `WeightUnits`, `CombinedWeight`, `weightWithUnits`)
   - Preserves weight information during concentrate filtering

2. **Comprehensive Backend Weight Field Population**
   - Sets all weight field variations consistently
   - Automatic weight extraction from product names

3. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Ensures fixes take effect immediately
   - Clears old cached data

4. **Concentrate Product Fixes**
   - Specifically addresses wax/concentrate weight display issues
   - Extracts weight from product names when missing

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- âœ… Weight values appearing in concentrate-filtered tags
- âœ… Consistent weight display across all product types
- âœ… Proper weight formatting (1g, 3.5g, 0.5oz, etc.)
- âœ… No more missing weight information in web-generated tags

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If you still don't see weight values:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check PythonAnywhere logs** for any errors
3. **Verify the WSGI file** is pointing to the correct path
4. **Restart the web app** if needed

### ðŸ“ž Need Help?

The deployment package includes all necessary files and fixes. Your concentrate products should now display weight information correctly on the web version!
