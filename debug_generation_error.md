# Debug: "No selected tags found" Generation Error

## Problem Analysis
You're getting this error when trying to generate labels:
```
POST https://www.agtpricetags.com/api/generate 400 (BAD REQUEST)
Error: No selected tags found in the data or failed to process records.
```

## Root Causes
Based on the code analysis, this error occurs when the backend can't find any valid records for the selected tags. The most common causes are:

### 1. No Tags Selected in UI
- **Symptom**: User clicks "Generate Tags" without selecting any product checkboxes
- **Solution**: Select at least one product from the available tags list before clicking generate

### 2. Invalid Tag Names
- **Symptom**: Selected tags don't match product names in the database
- **Solution**: Ensure you're selecting from the current loaded data

### 3. Data Not Loaded
- **Symptom**: No Excel file uploaded or database connection issue
- **Solution**: Upload an Excel file or ensure database connection is working

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check if Tags are Selected
Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:
```javascript
Generation request - persistentSelectedTags: [array of tags]
Generation request - persistentSelectedTags count: X
```

If count is 0, no tags are selected.

### Step 2: Verify Available Data
Check the application logs for:
```
Excel data loaded: True/False
Database product count: XXXX
```

### Step 3: Test with Known Good Data
Try generating with products that definitely exist:
- "Banana OG Distillate Cartridge" (confirmed working)
- Any product from the concentrate list with weight formatting

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Ensure Tags are Selected
1. Go to the main page
2. Use filters to find products (like "Concentrate" type)
3. **Actually click the checkboxes** next to products you want
4. Verify the "Selected Tags (X)" counter shows > 0
5. Then click "Generate Tags"

### Solution 2: Reload Data
1. Upload a fresh Excel file, OR
2. Use the "Load Default Data" if available
3. Wait for data to load completely
4. Select tags and try again

### Solution 3: Clear Session and Restart
1. Clear browser cache/cookies for the site
2. Refresh the page
3. Re-select products and try generating

## Advanced Debugging

If the basic solutions don't work, check browser console for:
```javascript
// These should show non-empty arrays
console.log('Available tags:', TagManager.state.tags.length);
console.log('Selected tags:', TagManager.state.persistentSelectedTags);
```

## Production Test Confirmation
I confirmed the API works correctly by testing:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"selected_tags": ["Banana OG Distillate Cartridge"], "template_type": "vertical", "scale_factor": 1.0}' \
  https://www.agtpricetags.com/api/generate
```
Result: HTTP 200 OK with successful DOCX generation.

This proves the backend is working - the issue is in tag selection/validation.

## Most Likely Fix
**You probably need to actually select some product checkboxes before clicking "Generate Tags".**

The error message suggests you're trying to generate labels without any products selected in the UI.
