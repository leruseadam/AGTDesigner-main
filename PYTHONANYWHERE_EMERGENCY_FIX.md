# 🚨 PYTHONANYWHERE EMERGENCY FIX GUIDE

## The Problem
Your PythonAnywhere site shows: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`

This means your `app.py` file is not in the right location for the WSGI file to find it.

## 🔍 DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Step 1: Check Your Files Location
1. Go to PythonAnywhere Dashboard → **Files** tab
2. Look for your uploaded files
3. Find where your `app.py` file is located
4. Note the full path (something like `/home/yourusername/`)

### Step 2: Upload Files if Missing
If you don't see your files:
1. Upload `AGTDesigner_deployment_with_wsgi_fix.zip` to your home directory
2. Extract it: `unzip AGTDesigner_deployment_with_wsgi_fix.zip`
3. This should create a folder with all your files including `app.py`

## 🛠️ FIX OPTIONS

### OPTION A: Use Debug WSGI (Recommended)
Replace your WSGI file content with this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import os

# This will automatically find your app.py file
wsgi_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Search for app.py starting from home directory
home_dir = os.path.expanduser('~')
project_home = wsgi_dir

# Look for app.py in the home directory and subdirectories
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(home_dir):
    if 'app.py' in files:
        project_home = root
        break
    if root.count(os.sep) - home_dir.count(os.sep) > 2:
        dirs[:] = []

# Add to Python path
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

# Change to project directory
os.chdir(project_home)

# Import Flask app
from app import app as application
```

### OPTION B: Manual Path Fix
If you know where your files are:
1. Replace the WSGI file content with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import os

# UPDATE THIS PATH to where your app.py file actually is
project_home = '/home/yourusername'  # Change this to your actual path

if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

os.chdir(project_home)
from app import app as application
```

2. Update the path to match your actual directory

## 📋 QUICK CHECKLIST

- [ ] Upload your deployment package to PythonAnywhere
- [ ] Extract the files (should include app.py)
- [ ] Update WSGI file with correct path
- [ ] Save and reload your web app
- [ ] Check error logs if still having issues

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT
After fixing the path, your site should load successfully with all weight field fixes active!
