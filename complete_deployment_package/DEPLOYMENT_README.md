- ✅ **All source code** - Full src/ directory with all modules
- ✅ **Templates & Static files** - Complete web interface
- ✅ **WSGI configuration** - Ready for production deployment
- ✅ **Requirements** - All Python dependencies listed
- ✅ **Test scripts** - Verify deployment before going live

## Quick Local Test

1. **Extract/Upload files** to your target directory
2. **Run the test**: `python3 test_deployment.py`
3. **If tests pass, start locally**: `./quick_start.sh`
4. **Open browser** to http://localhost:5000

## Production Deployment

### For PythonAnywhere:

1. **Upload all files** to your web app directory
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip3.x install --user -r requirements.txt`
3. **Set WSGI file** to point to your uploaded `wsgi.py`
4. **Set environment variables** in web app settings:
   - `SECRET_KEY` = your-secure-random-key
5. **Reload web app**

### For other hosting (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.):

1. **Upload files** maintaining directory structure
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configure web server** (Apache/Nginx) to point to `wsgi.py`
4. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key"
   export FLASK_ENV="production"
   ```
5. **Restart web server**

## Testing Your Deployment

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python3 test_deployment.py
```

The test will check:
- All required directories are present
- Python modules can be imported
- Database is accessible and has products
- Flask app can be imported and configured

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Missing modules error**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Database not found**
- Ensure `uploads/product_database_AGT_Bothell.db` exists
- Check file permissions

**3. Import errors**
- Verify all files were uploaded
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

**4. Concentrate weights not showing**
- Restart web server after deployment
- Verify the database contains concentrate products

### Getting Help:

1. **Run the test script first**: `python3 test_deployment.py`
2. **Check web server error logs**
3. **Verify all files were uploaded correctly**
4. **Ensure environment variables are set**
